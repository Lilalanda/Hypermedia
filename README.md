## Project Analysis

### User Profile: Lila Stephany Landa Pake

This hmtl project is my curriculum, showcasing my soft and hard skills. It includes information ranging from my academic formation to my extracurricular activities and other important information worth to be includede in the curriculum.

### Information Architecture

The website is structured into two primary sections:

### 1. **Blue Box Sidebar (Profile Section)**
The rectangle on the right side of the page, serves as the **profile section**. It contains essential personal information such as:
- **Profile Picture**: A professional photo that adds a personal touch to the page.
- **Contact Information**: Includes phone number, email, and location, making it easy for potential collaborators or employers to get in touch.
- **Social Media Links**: Provides direct links to my Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter profiles for easy networking and connection.


### 2. **Main Content Area (Whitespace - Resume & Academic Info)**
The main content area, referred to as the "whitespace," is dedicated to showcasing my resume, academic background, work experience, and language proficiency. It is broken down into clearly separated sections:
- **Academic Information**: Lists my educational background, including high school, international baccalaureate program, and university studies.
- **Work Experience**: Highlights my professional experiences and roles.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Provides insight into volunteer work and leadership roles outside of academics.
- **Languages**: Displays my proficiency in multiple languages, which is an important aspect of my global experience.

Just as seen before the main two sections are further divided into smaller blocks to maintain organized content, with headings and thin dividers used to visually separate each piece of information. This structure allows me to efficiently manage and update each section without disrupting the overall layout.
   

### Visual Design

The visual design of this portfolio reflects my personal taste. The layout is clean, modern, and user-friendly, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate through the content while experiencing a visually engaging presentation. Below are the key design choices made:

### **Color Scheme & Personal Touch**
- The **sidebox** is highlighted in a soft purple (`rgb(132, 108, 203)`), a color that I associate with my name, providing a personal connection to the design. This color contrasts with the neutral tones of the main content area.

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Images** have been incorporated alongside the text to enhance interactivity. These visuals make the page more engaging while maintaining a professional appearance. 
- **Social Media Links**: Direct links to my social media platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter) have been added to facilitate easy connection. These links enable viewers to quickly reach out or engage with my profile, enhancing networking opportunities.

### **Section Layout and Visual Aid**
- The content is organized into **distinct blocks**, each separated by thin rectangular dividers. This layout visually distinguishes different sections, such as "About Me," "Academic Information," and "Work Experience," making the page easy to navigate and digest.
  
### **Typography**
- A professional, **clear typography** has been used throughout, with distinct font choices for headings (e.g., `h1`, `h2`) and body text, ensuring readability.
